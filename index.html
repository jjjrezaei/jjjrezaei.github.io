<p> Hi, I'm</p>
<span style="color: #84e1ff"> <h1> JJ Rezaei. </h1> </span>
<p> I am a 3rd year Computer Science major at San Diego State University interested in application security. For more information about my work history, click <a href="resume.html">here</a> or the "resume" tab to the left. To see the projects I've worked on, scroll down!</p>
    
<p> In my spare time I like to cook, read, listen to music, and go on road trips! To learn more about those, click on the "personal" tab :) </p>    
<p> This website was graciously designed by Iraisa Van Vlassalaer and coded by myself</p>
