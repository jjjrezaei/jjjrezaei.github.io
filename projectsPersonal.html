<h3 style="color: lightslategray;";> Semm's Classroom Materials Website </h3>
<p>I began this project in September, 2024 with gathering the requirements. Professor Semm has thousands of text files from decades of teaching Sociology and he wanted them organized in one place. I needed a search bar that could search through the contents of his files and return the documents that contained those words. Of course, I also wanted to give him the ability to upload, preview, and download his files.
</p>
<p>Semm has over 1000 files in various different formats, so I cleaned it all to only keep doc, docx, pdf, html, and txt. I then used code I found online in Microsoft VBA to convert all .doc files to docx due to compatibility issues with the older .doc file type.
</p>
<p>In the summer, my friend <a href="https://emrysmayell.com/" target=_blank> Emrys </a> joined me in the creation of this website. He wrote front-end code and created search-bar functionality with PHP. I set up Nginx, SSL certification with Certbot, and registered our domain name with Porkbun in the Digital Ocean droplet funded by the GitHub Education Student Developer pack.
